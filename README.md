<h1>The Open Rave Website</h1>

This is a small Project of mine where I learn how to write a Website in bare PHP/HTML and how to set up a Webserver to host it. I use a LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), the Database part because i log requests for analysis, with Let's Encrypt for SSL Certification.
